Let’s ask AI to rewrite our good old classics.



I’ve started a small experiment: asking AI to recreate some nostalgic programming exercises in different languages. 😊



So far, I’ve tried:

- Conway's Game of Life (okay, not really a “game”!)

- Mars Rover



The goal is simple: explore how AI approaches the same problems across multiple languages and compare the results.



Feel free to contribute — add a new language, or suggest another classic challenge!
